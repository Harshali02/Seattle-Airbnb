# Seattle-Airbnb
AirBnb claims that ‘Shared Homes’ creates an extra income for existing homeowners and provides local experience to visiting tourists, creating a win-win situation. Any home owner with spare space can list the space and can host an Airbnb listing. Listing price is decided by home owner and in no way reflects the listing market in the neighbourhood. Many home owners are not capable enough or don’t want to research the listing market resulting in lower earnings. This project aims to use data generated by AirBnb in Seattle, Washington area to find interesting patterns and insights. We are trying to get the optimum price for the already existing listings and suggest them to the hosts.
